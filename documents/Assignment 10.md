SEO Overview
SEO stands for "search engine optimization". It's the practice of increasing both the quality and quantity
of website traffic, as well as exposure to your brand, through non paid search engine results. It's about
understanding what people are searching for online, the answers they are seeking, the words they're using,
and the type of content they wish to consume. Knowing the answers to these questions will allow you to connect to the people who are searching online for the solutions you offer. If knowing your audienceâ€™s intent is one side of the SEO coin, delivering it in a way search engine crawlers can find and understand is the other. Search engines are answer machines. They scour billions of pieces of content and evaluate thousands of factors to determine which content is most likely to answer your query.

SEO proposal
For my site, I would start with research into commonly searched keyword related to places, cocktail pics. I would then take that keyword research to determine what content my site can provide that would be of interest to the most users. I would implement those keywords across the site using metadata.

If this was a local business, I would localize the content and use directory listings like Moz Local to help people find the business.

As the site became more established, I would work on a plan for collaborating with other sites and organizations with strong content, so we could potentially trade links and help establish the site's authority.
